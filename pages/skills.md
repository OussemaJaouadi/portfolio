## Cloud & DevOps

### Programming Languages
- **Python**  
  *I've been using Python for over 9 years, applying it to a wide range of tasks including automation, scripting, backend development, data analysis, and more. It's my go-to language for rapid prototyping and production-ready solutions alike.*
- **Go**  
  *Used Echo, Gin frameworks, and GORM ORM for backend APIs.*
- **TypeScript/JavaScript**  
  *Prefer TypeScript for type safety; Express.js and NestJS for backend.*

### Containerization & Orchestration
- **Docker**  
  *I've been using Docker for around 4 years now, and it's become my go-to for setting up local dev environments. It's reliable, simple, and flexible.*
- **Docker Swarm**  
  *Spent about 2 years working with Docker Swarm. Used it extensively at Calgra Group to implement failover strategies that ensure 100% uptime during peak traffic.*
- **Kubernetes**  
  *My preference for the last 2 years. Working through the CKA/CKAD courses on KodeKloud. I use KinD for projects, but also tried K3d and loved it! Set up a kubeadm cluster for learning and actively create Kubernetes manifests using Helm and Kustomize.*
- **Hashicorp Nomad**  
  *I read about it recently and liked its simplicity. On my list to explore further.*

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- **Ansible**  
  *Started learning Ansible in early 2024 and quickly became a fan. Used it at Piterion to automate Joomla/Camunda deployments, eliminating manual errors.*
- **Terraform**  
  *Familiar with Terraform concepts and HCL syntax. Understand core concepts like tfstate but looking for more hands-on projects.*

### Cloud Platforms
- **AWS**  
  *Completed the AWS Solution Architect course. Familiar with core AWS services and architecture patterns though haven't had extensive hands-on experience yet.*
- **Azure**  
  *Basic experience with some services through Azure student pack.*
- **Hetzner**  
  *Used Hetzner cloud services at Calgra Group for CI/CD pipelines. Impressed by their simplicity and cost-effectiveness, especially with no data export fees.*

### CI/CD & GitOps
- **GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, Jenkins, ArgoCD**  
  *Automated deployments, established GitOps workflows.*

### Observability & Monitoring
- **Prometheus & Grafana**  
  *Deployed these using Helm charts in standalone setups. Instrumented monitoring for API performance and reliability metrics in the DevOps Academic Project.*
- **ELK Stack**  
  *Experience setting up Elasticsearch in multi-node clusters using Docker Compose and Kubernetes.*

### Message Brokers & Event Processing
- **RabbitMQ**  
  *Engineered AI-powered event workflows at Calgra Group using RabbitMQ for processing real-time predictions for mobile applications.*
- **MQTT, Kafka, Pub/Sub**  
  *Conceptual understanding of these messaging systems, though limited hands-on experience.*

## Security
- *Pentesting (Web, Crypto CTFs), Hack The Box, TryHackMe, secure manifests, Linux/Windows/AD, attack surface minimization.*

## Software Development

### Backend Development
- **Python Ecosystem**  
  *My daily driver for 9 yearsâ€”whether it's web dev, automation, scripting, LLM tinkering, or building personal tools, Python is my Swiss Army knife for getting things done fast and right.*
  - **Flask**: Great for rapid development, used in DevOps and Cybersecurity projects
  - **FastAPI**: Impressed by its data validation with Pydantic and async capabilities
- **Go**  
  *Echo, Gin, GORM for backend APIs.*
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**  
  *NestJS, Express.js for backend APIs.*
- **.NET**  
  *Explored and appreciated aspects compared to Java, especially SignalR and dependency injection. Found limitations in Entity Framework Core when switching database types.*

### Frontend Development
- **Angular**  
  *Some experience but not my primary focus.*
- **React**  
  *Basic knowledge from projects.*

### Databases
- **SQL Databases**  
  *MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite - worked with TypeORM and SQLAlchemy in backend projects.*
- **NoSQL Databases**  
  *MongoDB (with Mongoose/PyMongoose), Redis (with Redis_ORM).*
- **Search & Analytics**  
  *Elasticsearch - configured multi-node clusters in containerized environments.*

## AI & Machine Learning

### LLM Engineering
- **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)**  
  *Built RAG systems with both Mistral and Gemini models. Worked with embeddings and vector databases to enhance retrieval capabilities. Found this field exciting because it leverages software engineering skills more than traditional ML expertise.*
- **Agential AI**  
  *Experimented with AI agent architectures and their capabilities in software applications. Fascinated by how these systems can be designed to make autonomous decisions and learn from interactions.*
- **BERT & Foundation Models**  
  *Experience with BERT for classification tasks and understanding how foundation models can be fine-tuned for specific applications.*

## Cybersecurity
- **Infrastructure Security**  
  *Established container hardening guidelines at Trustable that were adopted into company security standards. Minimized attack surface and wrote secure manifests. Strong in Linux, good with Windows/Active Directory.*
- **Web Application Security**  
  *Crafted OWASP Top 10 vulnerability simulation platform for security training. CTF player (Web, Crypto), secure code review, and pentesting mindset.*
- **Penetration Testing**  
  *Experience with Hack The Box, TryHackMe, Nmap, Burpsuite, and custom Python testing automation. Specialized in CTFs (Web, Crypto).* 
- **Secure Coding Practices**  
  *Code review experience focused on identifying security flaws and minimizing risk.*
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**  
  *Implemented in Kubernetes contexts.*

## System Design & Architecture
- **Microservices Architecture**
- **Design Patterns**
- **UML & System Modeling**
- **Distributed Systems**
- **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**

## Version Control
- **Git, GitHub, GitLab**  
  *Version control is second nature at this point. Used extensively in all projects and professional roles.*
