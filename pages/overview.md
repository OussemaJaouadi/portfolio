# ðŸ“– Overview

As a recent graduate in Computer Networks and Telecommunication Engineering from the National Institute of Applied Science and Technologies (INSAT), I am actively seeking opportunities in DevOps and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE). My journey in technology has been driven by a passion for system architecture, adherence to best practices, and a commitment to continuous learning.

I have a solid foundation in DevOps, with hands-on experience in Docker, Kubernetes, Ansible, and a range of CI/CD tools. My background includes backend development and cybersecurity, with experience in CTF participation and challenge creation. Through internships and volunteer work, I have gained valuable project experience and technical skills.

Currently, I am pursuing certifications in AWS Cloud Practitioner and Kubernetes to further enhance my expertise. My professional values emphasize constructive feedback, trust, accountability, and a commitment to ongoing improvement.

I am eager to contribute my skills, enthusiasm, and fresh perspective to a dynamic team in the DevOps or SRE field. My objective is to engage in innovative projects and continue growing in cloud technologies, infrastructure as code, and secure system design.
