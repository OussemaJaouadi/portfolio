# ðŸ“– Overview

As a graduate in Computer Networks and Telecommunication Engineering from the National Institute of Applied Science and Technologies (INSAT) (Jun 2025), I am actively pursuing a career in Site Reliability Engineering (SRE). My journey in technology has been driven by a passion for system architecture, adherence to best practices, and a commitment to continuous learning.

I have a solid foundation in SRE and DevOps, with hands-on experience in Docker, Kubernetes, Ansible, and a range of CI/CD tools. My background includes backend development and a touch of security. Through internships and volunteer work, I have gained valuable project experience and technical skills.

I am currently pursuing certifications to further deepen my knowledge and skills. My professional ethos revolves around embracing constructive criticism, fostering trust and accountability, thriving on diverse perspectives, and striving for continuous improvement.

I am always open to new opportunities and environments, and I pride myself on being highly flexible and ready to relocate whenever exciting challenges arise. My adaptability allows me to thrive in diverse teams and settings, making me eager to contribute wherever my skills are needed most.

I am excited to contribute to projects that push the boundaries of what's possible, focusing on creating and refining systems that stand out for their robustness, efficiency, and innovation.
