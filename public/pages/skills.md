## DevOps

### Containerization
- **Docker**  
  *I've been using Docker for around 4 years now, and it's become my go-to for setting up local dev environments. It's reliable, simple, and flexible.*

### Container Orchestration
- **Docker Swarm**  
  *Spent about 2 years working with Docker Swarm. Itâ€™s good, but...*
- **Kubernetes**  
  *...Kubernetes has been my preference for the last year. Iâ€™m currently working through the CKA/CKAD courses on KodeKloud. While I mostly use KinD for projects, I recently tried K3d and loved it! I also set up a kubeadm cluster just out of curiosity. Additionally, Iâ€™ve been actively creating my own Kubernetes manifests and using tools like Helm and Kustomize to manage and customize deployments efficiently.*

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- **Ansible**  
  *Started learning Ansible in early 2024, and I quickly became a fan. Itâ€™s simple and agentlessâ€”exactly what I like in a tool.*
- **Terraform**
  *Basic Idea about Terraform and HCL syntaxe but I don't have the resources to try it on a cloud provider*

### Cloud 
- **AWS**
  *I recently completed Cloud Practitioner cours and I'm learning Solution Architect cours right now, But I don't have resources to have hands on labs*
- **Azure**
  *I used to play with some services since I had Azure student pack but very basic knowledge*

### CI/CD
- **GitLab CI**  
  *If I had to recommend just one CI/CD tool, it would be GitLab CI. Itâ€™s powerful and works best for what I do.*
- **GitHub Actions**  
  *I like GitHub Actions for its simplicity, especially when setting up workflows triggered by branch events.*
- **Jenkins**  
  *Iâ€™ve used Jenkins in university projects, but honestly, I prefer GitLab CI and GitHub Actionsâ€”way easier to work with.*

### GitOps
- **ArgoCD**  
  *A relatively new addition to my toolkit in Dec 2023, but I love how ArgoCD simplifies GitOps workflows.*

### Monitoring
- **Prometheus & Grafana**  
  *Iâ€™ve deployed these twice using Helm charts in a standalone setup. The combination works wonders for monitoring and observability.*

### DevSecOps
- **SonarQube**  

### Service Mesh
- **Istio** 
  *Basic Knowledge*
- **Consul**
  *Basic Knowledge, But willing to try it soon*  

## Concepts
- **Design Patterns**  
- **UML**  
- **System Design**  
- **Distributed Databases**  
- **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**  
  *Even though Iâ€™m more into DevOps, Iâ€™m always eager to dive into system design and improve the architecture of the code I work with.*
- **MQTT, Kafka, RabbitMQ, Pub/Sub**  
  *Iâ€™ve read extensively about these messaging and notification systems, and I have a solid understanding of how they work conceptually. Unfortunately, I havenâ€™t had the chance to implement or work with them hands-on yet, but theyâ€™re high on my list of things to dive into when time allows.*
 

## CyberSecurity
- **Code Review**  
- **Secure Coding**  
- **Web Application Penetration Testing**  
- **Linux & Windows Penetration Testing**  
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**  
  *I love the security side of DevOps, whether it's reviewing code or hands-on penetration testing.*

## Web Development
- **Backend-Focused**  
  *Frontend? Not my favorite. Backend is where I thrive.*
- **Nest.js**  
  *Nest.js? Absolutely love it.*
- **Express.js**  
  *When it comes to Express, I prefer using TypeScriptâ€”it just makes everything smoother.*
- **Flask**  
  *Flask is great for rapid development. Itâ€™s simple but gets the job done efficiently.*
- **FastAPI**  
  *Tried FastAPI recently. I was impressed by its focus on data validation with Pydantic and its asynchronous capabilities. Used it with PyMongo for a small project and enjoyed it.*
- **Django**  
  *Django is powerful, but Iâ€™m not its biggest fan. It's a bit too monolithic for my taste, especially when weâ€™re moving towards microservices these days.*
- **Spring Boot**  
  *Tried Spring Boot in university but didnâ€™t like it. The documentation felt weak, and I couldnâ€™t get comfortable with it.*
- **Angular**  
  *Used Angular a couple of times, but itâ€™s been three years since I last worked with it.*

## Programming Languages
- **Python**  
  *My daily driver! Iâ€™ve been using Python for 7 years now, and I love how versatile it is.*
- **JavaScript & TypeScript**  
  *I prefer TypeScript over JavaScript, hands down. The typing just makes things better.*
- **Java**  
  *Learned it in university but never liked it.*
- **C++**  
  *Studied in university, though I havenâ€™t touched it in a while.*

## Version Control Systems (VCS)
- **Git**  
- **GitHub**  
- **GitLab**  
  *Version control? Git is second nature at this point.*

## Databases
- **MySQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL**  
  *Worked with TypeORM and SQLAlchemy to manage these databases in my backend projects.*
- **MongoDB**  
  *Mongoose and PyMongoose have been my tools of choice for handling MongoDB.*
- **Redis**  
  *Used Redis_ORM to work with Redis, and I like how simple yet powerful it is.*
- **Elasticsearch**  
  *Iâ€™ve gone deep into setting up Elasticsearch environments using Docker Compose and Kubernetes. I know how to configure it into multi-node clusters and manage it well.*

## To Do & Learning Goals
- **AWS Certified Solution Architect**  
  *Iâ€™m currently studying for this certification, and after that, I plan to dive into Terraform.*
- **Terraform**  
  *Iâ€™ve read a lot about Terraform and understand the basics like tfstate, but I want to get hands-on after and writing some code even without resources only code for that. Pulumi also looks interesting, but Terraform is more common in the workplace.*
- **CKA/CKAD**  
  *Currently working through these certifications. Kubernetes mastery, here I come!*
- **Additional Goals**  
  *There are a bunch of tools Iâ€™m excited to exploreâ€”like HashiCorp Vault, Trivyâ€”and Iâ€™m keen to learn Go soon!*
